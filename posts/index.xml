But masks are not comfortable for everyone, which makes the control operation almost impossible to everyone.
Facial recognition applications with the deep leaning models could be an efficient way to detect people who does not respect this masks protocol in public places such as Public transport, Supermarket â€¦ In this article I will show you how I could implement a Face mask detector, with a high accuracy deep learning model.</description></item><item><title>Preferences compilation for decision support systems</title><link>https://elkheddoumi.github.io/posts/preferences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://elkheddoumi.github.io/posts/preferences/</guid><description>General context The Master&amp;rsquo;s level Internships provide the opportunity for hands-on experience in a student affairs setting. I had the chance to add an interesting experience to my CV by doing a 5-month internship with Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) as part of ANITI project. In this internship I worked on the following subject &amp;ldquo;Preferences compilation for decision support systems&amp;rdquo; in the next section I&amp;rsquo;ll explainto you the subject in more detail.</description></item></channel></rss>
